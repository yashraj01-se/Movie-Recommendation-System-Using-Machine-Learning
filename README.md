Movie Recommendation System â€“ ML

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine Learning to recommend movies based on content similarity.

ðŸ”¹ Techniques Used:

Text Processing: Combines movie overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew into a single tag.

Feature Extraction: Uses CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) to convert text into numerical vectors.

Similarity Measurement: Computes cosine similarity between movie vectors to find the most similar ones.

ðŸ”¹ Output:
Given a movie title, the model suggests top 5 similar movies based on content similarity.
